#ApiClient Command Line
## **UPDATES COMING SOON**
##Summary
This is a lightweight API client that handles GET requests. Api Client has a command line interface that prompts users to provide an endpoint for the API that they are trying to connect to. If the request is successful, the user will be prompted with a menu, asking if they would like the data to be pretty printed, and/or to save the data to a database.

##NOTES
- Developers may hardcode the host name or prompt the user for the host name as well.
- This program is not limited to Oracle databases😅 - you may use any database of your choice
- This API client gets database information and access tokens from environment variables for security purposes - please set them before running.
